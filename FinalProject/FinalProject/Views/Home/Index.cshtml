         <p class="centered2">We here at fight night are sick of choices. Sick of arguement over what to watch and what to eat.  We are
            extremely sick of endlessly scrolling through options on whatever streaming serive we use.  Our tool 
            takes infinite options and brings them head to head.  </p>
          
        <p class="centered3"> However, we still want to encourage just a bit of competition.  You will be given two choices.  If your partner chooses one and you don't agree,<strong>
    select the
    other option to reset your choices
</strong>. Dreams will be crushed. Potential futures will cease to exist. Hope of peaceful harmony might seem distant, until you both find an
        option you can agree on.
